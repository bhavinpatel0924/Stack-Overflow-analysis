# Stack Overflow Survey Analysis

## Project Motivation
I used the Stack Overflow Survey 2018-2020 datasets to explore and understand:

* What were the trends in the usage of a particular programming language from year to year?
* How do developers approach problems that they're stuck on?
* Why do most people look for new jobs?
* Which jobs have the highest job satisfaction?
* Does education level have an impact on job satisfaction?

## File Description
My repository contains exploratory data analysis on each question that I explored above.

## Resources Used

* **Datasets:** https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
* **Python:** Version 3.7
* **Libraries:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, collection

## Results

My findings can be found [here](https://bhavinpatel0924.medium.com/stackoverflow-survey-2020-analysis-78b0f493bf73) in medium blog post that I wrote.
