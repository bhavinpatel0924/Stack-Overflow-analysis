* What were the trends in the usage of a particular programming language from year to year?
* How do developers approach problems that they're stuck on?
* Why do most people look for new jobs?
* Which jobs have the highest job satisfaction?
* Does education level have an impact on job satisfaction?

## Resources Used

* **Libraries:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, collection

## Results

My findings can be found [link to google](https://www.google.com) in medium blog post that I wrote.
